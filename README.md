# _printf project
This project is about creating a similar function to that of printf in C Programming, putting into practice the tools that were given by **Holberton School**.

# Functionality
The syntax for using this functions is `_printf("%parameter text", paramter);`
We can also use different types of variables in function, for example:

## Char:
 * Input : `_printf("%c is the last letter in the alphabet\n", 'z');`
 * Output : `z is the last letter in the alphabet`

## String
 * Input: `_printf("I %s\n", 'am writing a string');`
 * Output: `I am writing a string`

## Integer
 * Input: `_printf("The number %i is positive\n", 5);`
 * Output: `The number 5 is positive`

## Decimal
 * Input: `_printf("The value of pi is %d\n", 3.1416);`
 * Output: `The value of pi is 3.1416`
